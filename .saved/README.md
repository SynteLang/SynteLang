# This directory contains listings saved by the author that are grouped by date

You can use these as examples to try out.

Bear in mind that mutes, solos etc are not preserved.
For that reason, we suggest loading and soloing each listing in turn.

The motivation for uploading them to the repo is to maintain an archive of ideas, they are generally rough sketches and experiments.
