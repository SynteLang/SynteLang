## Utilities

+ `functions.go` pretty-prints functions in `functions.json`. It also is used to process your personal usage stats with the `-u` flag; and formats function documentation with the `--docs` flag.
+ `test.go ` parses and prints examples from main `README.md` as concatenated run-able listings. Wav samples are loaded as `local.wav` which must be present in `wavs/`
